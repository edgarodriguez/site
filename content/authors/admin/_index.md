I am an Industrial Engineer with 10+ years of experience as advisor and project manager in Logistics, ERP, Business Intelligence, and Sustainability. I have led multiple implementations in Enterprise Resource Planning (Aasasoft and Odoo), and BI (Bitam, KPIOnline and Tableau). Moreover, I have supervised and conducted training programs to transfer requirements to interdisciplinary teams within all hierarchical levels, and in different productive sectors (retail, financial and academic sectors). Years ago, I understood that a triple bottom line approach is essential to measure success from KPIs, which motivated me to redirect my profile towards Sustainability and Data Science.

Since then, I have specialized in academic research on methodologies as Sustainability Balanced Scorecard, Trade-offs and synergies of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), GHG inventories, Ecosystem Services and Backcasting. In addition, I have researched and published case studies in Mexico and Spain about the Nexus WEFL (water, energy, food and land), climate change and societal metabolism; using quantitative analysis (R), Spatial Analysis (QGIS), and data wrangling and processing (SQL, Tableau Prep).

My background has given me the opportunity to work with multi-cultural and interdisciplinary teams. Also, it has enabled a continuous learning process (I am a MOOC-holic) in aspects of programming, data science, and data visualization, which has improved my abilities to communicate and publish technical results among stakeholders.

I am enthusiasm for analyzing climate change with a systemic-thinking approach, applying green infrastructure for adaptation projects. I hope that one day, every neighborhood will have an urban garden and an arboretum.
