The main objectives of this project are:
1. Create a repository of different open-source data analysis tools (with R) to understand the resilience and complexity around it. Including datasets, case studies and work papers.

2. Recognize popular methods, and create an environment to generate reproducible research.

3. Identify research groups thought a bibliographic network to encourage a multi-discipliary collaboration.
