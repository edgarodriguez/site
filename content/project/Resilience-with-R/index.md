The main objectives of this project are:
- Create a repository of different open-source data analysis tools (with R) to understand the resilience and complexity around it. Including datasets, case studies and work papers.

- Recognize popular methods, and create an environment to generate reproducible research.

- Identify research groups thought a bibliographic network to encourage a multi-discipliary collaboration.
