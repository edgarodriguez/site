In Mexico, we only talk about personal characteristics (age, obesity, etc.), 
I am convinced that the urban environment as (quality of public services) has significant relevance.
The aim of this project is to identify what urban characteristics affect the number of infections and deaths from COVID-19. Also, we are comparing official data and other sources to measure the real impact of COVID-19 in the mortality rate.
