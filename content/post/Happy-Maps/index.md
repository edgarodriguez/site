What if we stop looking for the most efficient route?

Thanks to projects like ['Happy maps'](http://goodcitylife.org/) it is possible to analyze beyond which is the shortest route.
Data mining and [Participatory Geographical Information Systems (PGIS)](https://www.participatorymethods.org/method/participatory-geographical-information-systems-pgis) make possible to identify points of interest, parks, recreation areas that result in a more pleasant journey. 
A remarkable way of how spatial analysis creates solutions for the well-being of the community, and provides a full experience of the city.
