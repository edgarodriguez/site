Before knowing `blogdown` and how easy it is to create web pages from [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). I started a project to develop a website from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and convert it to a static site to publish it from [Github-Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Although the website never saw the daylight, I configured it to until have a final version. If you do not know `R` and Rstudio, perhaps it could be an alternative to consider.

Here are the basic steps and a very illustrative video on how to create a static page from Wordpress and publish it on gh-pages:

1. Install [WAMP64](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
2. Create database in `PHPadmin` *(i.e. http:/localhost:8012/phpmyadmin)*
3. Create repository on Github
    3.1 Configure Github repository with `gh-pages` as default branch
    3.2. Add an empty `.nojekyll` file in the repository root

4. With GitHub desktop, clone the repository and put it as local folder
    *(i.e C:/wamp64/www/"repository name")*

5. Download, unzip, and paste the [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) files in a local folder.
6. Open database installation location (step 1): *(i.e. http:/localhost:port/"database name")* to install Wordpress
7. Install Wordpress: **database host: localhost** and **port-of-MySQL (i.e. 3308)**
8. From Wordpress, Install [WP2Static](https://wp2static.com/).
9. Select `zip` file option (Although there is an option to export to Github-pages, it gave me several errors during the process).
10. In the configuration of [WP2Static](https://wp2static.com/), define URL destination.
11. Unzip, copy and paste he generated file into the local folder (step 3).
12. Commit and pull from Github desktop.
